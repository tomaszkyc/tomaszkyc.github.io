      <description>Hello fellows. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well and maybe bake some delicious christmas cakes. That was a preety long year for me. Especially when I list some events there:
 Learning .NET Core and Angular Making diploma project and finishing my CS studies with 5.0 grade Developing my Java and Python skills Unexpected changing a job (which maybe I will describe in the future)  But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to slow down, take a deep breath and spend some time with closest people out there.</description>
