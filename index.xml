      <description>Hello fellows. I hope you&amp;rsquo;re doing well and maybe bake some delicious christmas cakes. That was a preety long year for me. Especially when I list some events there:
 Learning .NET Core and Angular Making diploma project and finishing my CS studies with 5.0 grade Developing my Java and Python skills Unexpected changing a job (which maybe I will describe in the future)  But now it&amp;rsquo;s time to slow down, take a deep breath and spend some time with closest people out there.</description>

      <description>This took too long time, but here it isA while back, I&amp;rsquo;ve started learning .NET Core (and it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress). But as a result and in some way training I made an web app&amp;hellip; to make your links shorter!
Here you can check the repo with code and additional info.
What next? Maybe another .NET Core project?I wanted to do this but there are also other skills I need to develop and they just can&amp;rsquo;t wait ðŸ˜… Also in this semester I have to write my thesis and pass 5 other exams soo a lot of work to do and not too much time.</description>

      <description>December is a great time to&amp;hellip; start learning new things. You know - the atmosphere of New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolution and bringing somethink new to&amp;hellip; your projects and skills.
ASP.NET 3.5 Web Forms - what a &amp;hellip;At the universtity this year I&amp;rsquo;ve started classes &amp;ldquo;Web application programming&amp;rdquo;. I thought it would be&amp;hellip; wait for it&amp;hellip; breathtakingm but it is not. We are learning a little old. We are learning outdated technology which for me - it&amp;rsquo;s a little bit puzzling.</description>

      <description>Welcome to my webpage and I&amp;rsquo;m glad you&amp;rsquo;re reading this! This is a first post I&amp;rsquo;ve written here and probably not last :wink:.
Why I created this website?That&amp;rsquo;s a tricky question. Probably because I wanted to gather information and knowledge in one place where I can share with others. Also it can be a space where I can share with you some materials about technologies I&amp;rsquo;m working with (checkout about section).</description>
